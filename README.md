## Projects

### LOL recommender system
- League of Legends is an online, 5 vs. 5 competitive PC game. It is one of the - if not the most - popular games currently around. Despite that LoL has surprisingly little mainstream coverage, which is most likely due to its complexity - itâ€™s not an easy game to understand. A lot of professional leagues and tournaments for LoL are held around the world. The top prize for the best team is over five million dollars and the average player makes a six-figure income. Can we develop a data-driven recommender system using historical game data to support players in making better decisions?

### Minor Detection
- This project aims to prevent underage people from trying to enter establishments where they are not allowed. However, the perpetrators can easily gain access to said establishments by generating fake identity proofs. The idea of the project is to create a solution that offers real-time face detection and age prediction capabilities within a fraction of the time to ensure there are no people who are underage in the establishments.

### Parking Hassle
- To recognize vacant spots in photos, this project is aimed at creating a Python program that employs object detection techniques for parking space identification.  The information utilized in this undertaking was acquired from a freely available dataset.  The images of a parking lot in the dataset had bounding box annotations surrounding parking spaces.
