### LOL recommender syatem
- League of Legends is an online, 5 vs. 5 competitive PC game. It is one of the - if not the most - popular games currently around. Despite that LoL has surprisingly little mainstream coverage, which is most likely due to its complexity - itâ€™s not an easy game to understand. A lot of professional leagues and tournaments for LoL are held around the world. The top prize for the best team is over five million dollars and the average player makes a six-figure income. Can we develop a data-driven recommender system using historical game data to support players to make better decisions?
